The classic pursuit mode is extended with two additional modes: Getaway and Time Trap. In Getaway the player needs to shake off the police in a set amount of time, or playing as the police trap a speeder before time runs out. In Time Trap an entire race needs to be completed before time runs out, or as the police all speeders need to be arrested.

The Pursuit mode is available in multiplayer as well and players can take different sides or race together.\n\nIt is the first game in the series to introduce a Career mode with a set of challenges. Beating these is rewarded with trophies for unlocks, and money to spend on new cars, repairs and upgrades. In the PlayStation version the Career mode is split up into two different sets of challenges: Tournament (required races) and Special Event (optional races). High Stakes in the title refers to races where players bet their cars. In the PC version these are a part of the Career mode when the player owns more than two cars. In the PlayStation version two players can insert their memory cards and race against each other. The winner immediately receives the opponent's car and it is deleted from the loser's memory card right away.\n\nIn addition to the new game modes it is also the first game in the series to have a detailed physics models.

And how can Low keep his team from unraveling in the face of such uncertainly? To return to Earth, the must dig for answer, both on the planet's surface and deep within themselves.\n\nFrom the combined talents of LucasArts and legendary filmmaker Steven Spielberg comes an epic adventure that plunges headlong into the very core of the unknown. And takes you with it.","total_rating":65.08989553620246,"total_rating_count":87},{"id":216,"cover":{"id":84279,"image_id":"co1t13"},"genres":[{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":22369,"company":{"id":130,"name":"MacSoft Games"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":22370,"company":{"id":2,"name":"BioWare"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":237656,"company":{"id":2406,"name":"Atari, Inc."},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":237967,"company":{"id":213,"name":"Infogrames"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Neverwinter Nights","release_dates":[{"id":3788,"date":1056067200,"human":"Jun 20, 2003","y":2003},{"id":3789,"date":1059696000,"human":"Aug 2003","y":2003},{"id":19557,"date":1024358400,"human":"Jun 18, 2002","y":2002},{"id":19558,"date":1025654400,"human":"Jul 03, 2002","y":2002}],"screenshots":[{"id":99,"image_id":"cmgtkrfn5hprtq7kjkxr"},{"id":1724,"image_id":"poy1e4oijtnl1hath9sq"},{"id":1725,"image_id":"pwpxyppguy7e1kkdg0pn"},{"id":1726,"image_id":"tndzfgpzwf4o9ur0wvfj"},{"id":1727,"image_id":"n0dwmoy474ndyoy11cpr"}],"summary":"Neverwinter Nights (NWN) is a third-person role-playing video game and is set in the fantasy world of the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, with the game mechanics based on the Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition rules.

It was released on November 21, 2003 and is a reboot of the landmark video game series Prince of Persia, created by Jordan Mechner in 1989.\n\nThe Sands of Time, developed internally at Ubisoft Montreal, successfully captures the mechanics of the original platformer and extends it to the 3D generation. An earlier attempt by The Learning Company to transfer the game to 3D (Prince of Persia 3D) was released in 1999, but despite its initial good reception failed to sell enough and the company responsible for the original trilogy was already closing doors. The game was praised for its visual design, finely tuned game mechanics and intriguing storyline, winning the game several awards.\n\nThe game was developed for the PC, PlayStation 2, GameCube, Xbox, and later a 2D-version for the Game Boy Advance and mobile phones. The success of The Sands of Time led to three followups, Prince of Persia: Warrior Within (2004), Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones (2005), and Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (2010). A remastered, high-definition, version of The Sands of Time was released on the PlayStation Network for the PlayStation 3 on November 16, 2010.","total_rating":83.204461363017,"total_rating_count":615},{"id":843,"cover":{"id":212096,"image_id":"co4jnk"},"genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Platform"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":165022,"company":{"id":702,"name":"Ubisoft Montpellier"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":210738,"company":{"id":104,"name":"Ubisoft Entertainment"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":224715,"company":{"id":812,"name":"Gradiente"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Rayman 2: The Great Escape","release_dates":[{"id":545612,"human":"TBD"},{"id":545613,"date":941328000,"human":"Oct 31, 1999","y":1999},{"id":545614,"date":940550400,"human":"Oct 22, 1999","y":1999}],"screenshots":[{"id":40692,"image_id":"tfsd0jextrgamwam6uic"},{"id":40693,"image_id":"ubysryri3h4ve9gtlqde"},{"id":40694,"image_id":"rchshoav4tqwwhq6wxei"},{"id":40695,"image_id":"p5f6jjdumqgwkdczoqgv"}],"summary":"With its enchanted storybook look beautifully translated into 3D, lush, vibrant colors, funny enemy designs, and clever jumping puzzles, Rayman 2 is platforming perfection.

In 2293, a human named Malcolm dethroned him and became champion himself. A huge media figure, Malcolm is hailed as the biggest star in human history and is worshipped as a god. His success nets great rewards for his sponsoring corporation, attracting the attention of jealous rivals both in the arenas of the Tournament and in the corridors of power a galaxy away. Liandri attempted to win back the champion title with Xan MK2 but failed (unknown to the other contestants, each member of the Corrupt is purely robotic, including Xan).\nNow it is 2302.

The aging Sniper Rifle (a relic of centuries past) is removed from the Tournament as is \"Assault\" - a team-based event that forms a part of the competition. Many fans of the Tournament complain at these changes, with some combatants refusing to participate in the new format. Malcolm, shortly after his victory, hired two of his former opponents (Brock and Lauren, members of the former Iron Guard team) as teammates in his reformed Thunder Crash team.

A worm can be killed either by having its health reduced to zero or being knocked into the water around and below the level.","total_rating":81.6826633922855,"total_rating_count":71},{"id":948,"cover":{"id":82380,"image_id":"co1rkc"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"},{"id":8,"name":"Platform"},{"id":15,"name":"Strategy"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":143461,"company":{"id":213,"name":"Infogrames"},"developer":true,"publisher":true},{"id":143462,"company":{"id":191,"name":"Imagineer"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":143463,"company":{"id":12843,"name":"Russobit-M"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":143464,"company":{"id":197,"name":"THQ"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":143465,"company":{"id":5176,"name":"Sold Out Sales & Marketing"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":203828,"company":{"id":16437,"name":"Team17"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":203829,"company":{"id":9150,"name":"MicroProse Software, Inc."},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":203830,"company":{"id":16437,"name":"Team17"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":203831,"company":{"id":37694,"name":"Acer TWP"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Worms Armageddon","release_dates":[{"id":85125,"date":917568000,"human":"Jan 29, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300963,"date":930182400,"human":"Jun 24, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300964,"date":943920000,"human":"Nov 30, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300965,"date":943920000,"human":"Nov 30, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300966,"date":954374400,"human":"Mar 30, 2000","y":2000},{"id":300969,"date":918691200,"human":"Feb 11, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300970,"date":927849600,"human":"May 28, 1999","y":1999},{"id":300972,"date":1317600000,"human":"Oct 03, 2011","y":2011},{"id":300973,"date":1317600000,"human":"Oct 03, 2011","y":2011},{"id":450886,"date":943920000,"human":"Nov 30, 1999","y":1999},{"id":450887,"date":1363737600,"human":"Mar 20, 2013","y":2013},{"id":450888,"date":943920000,"human":"Nov 30, 1999","y":1999},{"id":450889,"date":944870400,"human":"Dec 11, 1999","y":1999}],"screenshots":[{"id":129011,"image_id":"ec0hct002fnnddaf5wbt"},{"id":129012,"image_id":"rpfgg4p7cxb3bnucqvrt"},{"id":129013,"image_id":"mb6vch8neihpntatvzne"},{"id":129014,"image_id":"frh8cmm00ffarv1dotqi"},{"id":129015,"image_id":"fawtkmi1yij9u4edbtfz"}],"summary":"Those intrepid invertebrates return with a vengeance in the much-loved Worms Armageddon.

It is a platformer with puzzle-solving elements, focusing on the portrayal of a weak, underpowered character in a grim and hostile world, who has to rely on his cunning to outwit enemies and overcome hazards. The game has pre-rendered background graphics and uses CG movies of similar style to advance the story between the levels.\n\nThe main character Abe is almost completely helpless: he cannot use weapons and is usually instantly killed by his brutal enemies if he confronts them directly. For this reason, most of the game involves careful exploration, timed movement, sneaking, and outsmarting the foes through various means: throwing stones to confuse them, luring them into traps, etc. Abe can run, jump, climb, tiptoe, crouch, and roll; in most areas these actions are essential to his survival. A few stages involve Abe riding a large animal known as Elum.\n\nAbe's only special power is chanting, which he can use to stun certain enemies for a while or possess them. When Abe possess an enemy he gains his abilities: for example, possessing the body or a ferocious Slig allows the player to shoot from his machine gun, communicate with other creatures of his kind, and even commit suicide, clearing the way for Abe.","total_rating":91.091076181483,"total_rating_count":198},{"id":1000,"cover":{"id":173511,"image_id":"co3pvr"},"genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Platform"},{"id":9,"name":"Puzzle"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":178231,"company":{"id":727,"name":"Oddworld Inhabitants"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":178232,"company":{"id":205,"name":"GT Interactive Software"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":178234,"company":{"id":727,"name":"Oddworld Inhabitants"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":178257,"company":{"id":311,"name":"Digital Dialect"},"developer":false,"publisher":false}],"name":"Oddworld: Abe's Exoddus","release_dates":[{"id":371853,"date":935625600,"human":"Aug 26, 1999","y":1999},{"id":371854,"date":914025600,"human":"Dec 19, 1998","y":1998},{"id":371855,"date":914025600,"human":"Dec 19, 1998","y":1998},{"id":371856,"date":1275436800,"human":"Jun 02, 2010","y":2010},{"id":371857,"date":1275436800,"human":"Jun 02, 2010","y":2010},{"id":371858,"date":1256169600,"human":"Oct 22, 2009","y":2009},{"id":371859,"date":1275436800,"human":"Jun 02, 2010","y":2010},{"id":371860,"date":1219881600,"human":"Aug 28, 2008","y":2008},{"id":371912,"date":1256169600,"human":"Oct 22, 2009","y":2009},{"id":371913,"date":1256169600,"human":"Oct 22, 2009","y":2009},{"id":375319,"date":911260800,"human":"Nov 17, 1998","y":1998},{"id":375320,"date":912124800,"human":"Nov 27, 1998","y":1998},{"id":432358,"date":1671494400,"human":"Dec 20, 2022","y":2022},{"id":432359,"date":1671494400,"human":"Dec 20, 2022","y":2022}],"screenshots":[{"id":831844,"image_id":"schtus"},{"id":831845,"image_id":"schtut"},{"id":831846,"image_id":"schtuu"},{"id":831847,"image_id":"schtuv"},{"id":831848,"image_id":"schtuw"},{"id":831849,"image_id":"schtux"}],"summary":"Abe’s peaceful retirement was shattered when visited by a vision from the Three Weirdos.

It was one of the most highly anticipated games of its age, and is listed among the greatest video games ever created by numerous websites and magazines. The gameplay of Ocarina of Time was revolutionary for its time, it has arguably made more of an impact on later games in the series than any of its predecessors even though they had the same cores of exploration, dungeons, puzzles and item usage. Among the gameplay mechanics, one of the most noteworthy is the time-traveling system. The game begins with the player controlling the child Link, but later on an adult Link becomes a playable character as well and each of them has certain unique abilities. Ocarina of Time also introduces the use of music to solve puzzles: as new songs are learned, they can be used to solve puzzles, gain access to new areas and warp to different locations. Dungeon exploration is somewhat more puzzle-oriented than in earlier games but they are not too complex.","total_rating":92.15884995659097,"total_rating_count":1628},{"id":1030,"cover":{"id":172745,"image_id":"co3pah"},"genres":[{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":148205,"company":{"id":70,"name":"Nintendo"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":199228,"company":{"id":1366,"name":"Nintendo EAD Software Development Group No.3"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":224724,"company":{"id":812,"name":"Gradiente"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask","release_dates":[{"id":496306,"human":"TBD"},{"id":509549,"date":974419200,"human":"Nov 17, 2000","y":2000},{"id":509550,"date":972518400,"human":"Oct 26, 2000","y":2000},{"id":509551,"date":956793600,"human":"Apr 27, 2000","y":2000},{"id":509553,"date":1238716800,"human":"Apr 03, 2009","y":2009},{"id":509554,"date":1242604800,"human":"May 18, 2009","y":2009},{"id":509555,"date":1238716800,"human":"Apr 03, 2009","y":2009},{"id":509556,"date":1239062400,"human":"Apr 07, 2009","y":2009},{"id":509557,"date":1466640000,"human":"Jun 23, 2016","y":2016},{"id":509558,"date":1479945600,"human":"Nov 24, 2016","y":2016},{"id":549114,"date":1041292800,"human":"2002","y":2002}],"screenshots":[{"id":951657,"image_id":"sckeax"},{"id":951658,"image_id":"sckeay"},{"id":951659,"image_id":"sckeaz"},{"id":951660,"image_id":"sckeb0"},{"id":951661,"image_id":"sckeb1"},{"id":951662,"image_id":"sckeb2"},{"id":951663,"image_id":"sckeb3"},{"id":951664,"image_id":"sckeb4"},{"id":951665,"image_id":"sckeb5"},{"id":951666,"image_id":"sckeb6"},{"id":951667,"image_id":"sckeb7"},{"id":951668,"image_id":"sckeb8"}],"summary":"The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask is a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, it utilizes the same engine and visual style as its predecessor.

The game combines characters and settings from Disney's animated features with those from the Final Fantasy series, developed by Square.\n\nKingdom Hearts was a departure from Square's standard role-playing games by introducing a substantial action-adventure element. In addition, it has an all-star voice cast which included many of the Disney characters' official voice actors. Kingdom Hearts was longtime Square character designer Tetsuya Nomura's first time in a directorial position.\n\nThe game uses an experience based progression system, with experience gained by defeating foes. Experience gained rises in relation to the strength of the foe, and is consistent for each enemy over the course of the game. Levels are gained with experience, and provide increases to stat attributes in strength, defence, magic, hit points, magic points and ability points, with a new, predetermined ability unlocked approximately every four levels.","total_rating":81.15730086121704,"total_rating_count":462},{"id":1242,"cover":{"id":153856,"image_id":"co3aps"},"genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Fighting"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":119779,"company":{"id":263,"name":"Namco"},"developer":true,"publisher":true},{"id":197740,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Tekken","release_dates":[{"id":3234,"date":786931200,"human":"Dec 09, 1994","y":1994},{"id":3235,"date":796608000,"human":"Mar 31, 1995","y":1995},{"id":230018,"date":1301529600,"human":"Mar 31, 2011","y":2011},{"id":230019,"date":1301529600,"human":"Mar 31, 2011","y":2011},{"id":230020,"date":1301529600,"human":"Mar 31, 2011","y":2011}],"screenshots":[{"id":43252,"image_id":"agxul38tyy2loqroks3v"},{"id":43253,"image_id":"mnhyh1bwb5pyz6s4donc"},{"id":43254,"image_id":"qpzhdnhcs7j2bq9yic5v"}],"summary":"Seventeen of the world's deadliest fighters, explosive martial arts moves and savage special attacks.

Another big change in movement was that jumping was toned down, no longer allowing fighters to jump to extreme heights (as was present in previous games), but keeping leaps to reasonable, realistic heights. It made air combat more controllable, and put more use to sidestep dodges, as jumping no longer became a universal dodge move that was flying above all of the ground moves. Other than that, the improved engine allowed for quick recoveries from knock-downs, more escapes from tackles and stuns, better juggling (as many old moves had changed parameters, allowing them to connect in combo-situations, where they wouldn't connect in previous games) and extra newly created combo throws.\n\nTekken 3 was the first Tekken to feature a beat 'em up minigame called \"Tekken Force\", which pitted the player in various stages against enemies in a side-scrolling fashion. If the player succeeds in beating the minigame four times, Dr. Bosconovitch would be a playable character (granted that you defeat him first). This was continued in Tekken 4 and succeeded by the Devil Within minigame in Tekken 5 - but Boskonovitch was dropped as a playable character after Tekken 3. There is also a minigame \"Tekken Ball\", similar to beach volleyball, where one has to hit the ball with a powerful attack to hurt the opponent or try to hit the ball in such a way that it hits the ground in the opponent's area, thus causing damage.","total_rating":84.69531239159282,"total_rating_count":496},{"id":1245,"cover":{"id":195400,"image_id":"co46rs"},"genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Fighting"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":2782,"company":{"id":263,"name":"Namco"},"developer":true,"publisher":true},{"id":50936,"company":{"id":10070,"name":"Namco Hometek"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":222907,"company":{"id":13634,"name":"Sony Computer Entertainment"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Tekken 4","release_dates":[{"id":322511,"date":993945600,"human":"Jul 2001","y":2001},{"id":322512,"date":1017100800,"human":"Mar 26, 2002","y":2002},{"id":322513,"date":1032739200,"human":"Sep 23, 2002","y":2002},{"id":322514,"date":1031875200,"human":"Sep 13, 2002","y":2002}],"screenshots":[{"id":44480,"image_id":"q6uk42wvn6nsr3rdmeb9"},{"id":44481,"image_id":"kkyta9v8rfgh5brwficm"},{"id":44482,"image_id":"v0lehhnrfnx7h7ukboq7"},{"id":44483,"image_id":"ugpvjw8n4wd4uyfbixjj"}],"summary":"Tekken 4 marks the return of Namco's premier fighting franchise, Tekken.

Briefings take place at the start of each mission, which advance the plot and introduce new characters. Each mission is structured through a number of linear levels, each with differing locations, levels of action and styles of gameplay. Initially the player character begins on the frontlines during D-Day backed up by other computer AI-controlled soldiers with an emphasis on fast action-orientated gun-based gameplay. As the story progress however, the player character is sent on a variety of other missions including a number of covert and undercover operations in locations such as military based, German-occupied towns and manors, submarines and countryside settings. The player character is tasked with objectives during levels that range from infiltration, espionage, rescue and recon. Because of the variety between missions and locations, gameplay also changes pace. While many missions involve Allied assaults on German targets others include elements of stealth and exploration. For example one selections of missions has the player detach from an allied raid to infiltrate a German U-Boat in order to get to a secret facility while another has them rendezvous and sneak into a German headquarters in disguise to rescue an operative. Many missions are performed solo yet some include an AI companion for backup. Health is determined by a health bar that can be replenished using a selection \"medikits\" found throughout levels with varying degrees of effect.\n\nDuring missions, players can earn medals by the end of each level be meeting requirements such as completions of objectives, eliminating an amount of enemies and maintaining a percentage of health throughout, all represented by a bronze, silver or gold star.","total_rating":85.420170234615,"total_rating_count":95},{"id":1316,"cover":{"id":132442,"image_id":"co2u6y"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":7412,"company":{"id":140,"name":"EA Los Angeles"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":7413,"company":{"id":1,"name":"Electronic Arts"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Medal of Honor: Rising Sun","release_dates":[{"id":27075,"date":1068508800,"human":"Nov 11, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27076,"date":1069977600,"human":"Nov 28, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27077,"date":1070496000,"human":"Dec 04, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27078,"date":1070496000,"human":"Dec 04, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27079,"date":1069977600,"human":"Nov 28, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27080,"date":1068508800,"human":"Nov 11, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27081,"date":1068508800,"human":"Nov 11, 2003","y":2003},{"id":27082,"date":1069977600,"human":"Nov 28, 2003","y":2003}],"screenshots":[{"id":1400,"image_id":"bipamapiioobbavknyfx"},{"id":1166898,"image_id":"scp0du"},{"id":1166899,"image_id":"scp0dv"}],"summary":"First-person shooter set in the Pacific theatre of WWII, beginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor and moving through the campaign with you playing as a young recruit chosen for various historical missions such as the raid on Guadalcanal.

The gameplay of DOA2, and all subsequent Dead or Alive games, borrows heavily from the Virtua Fighter series, but makes some key changes that drastically changes the way Dead or Alive is played in comparison to Virtua Fighter. In DOA2, the basis of the entire fighting system is the circular relationship between three types of moves: blows, throws, and holds.The other defining feature of DOA2, aside from blows/throws/holds, is its stun system. In DOA2 many attacks upon hitting will inflict a stun on the opponent. While stunned, the opponent cannot attack, and cannot guard, but they can hold. If the attacker lands a non-knockdown, non-launching attack while the opponent is stunned, the opponent will be re-stunned in a new way, depending on what attack was landed. A major difference between DOA2 and other fighters was in the safety and non-punishability of attacks, both upon hitting and upon being blocked. Most blows in DOA2 can be punished on hit and block by each character's faster throws, making blow-based offense very risky. In addition to the normal rules of juggling, each character also fits into a specific weight category, which affects how the character responds to being launched and being juggled. In DOA2, fights can occur on either water or ice; when a character is on such a surface, all non-knockdown, non-launching attacks will induce a stun on any successful hit. Walls and falls in the middle of stages are everywhere in the game. Many stages are also multi-tiered: to get to other areas of the stage, one character must be knocked off a ledge and fall into the next area. These falls deal usually fairly high damage, but cannot knock the opponent out. Other notable features included introducing CG cutscenes in line with the plot, replacing the original \"Danger Zone\" areas in stages with fully interactive ones, allowing players to juggle each other into walls, propelling characters from landmarks for more damage.","total_rating":77.77442775035061,"total_rating_count":64},{"id":1404,"cover":{"id":93903,"image_id":"co20gf"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"},{"id":8,"name":"Platform"},{"id":33,"name":"Arcade"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":98414,"company":{"id":4501,"name":"DotEmu"},"developer":false,"publisher":false},{"id":181238,"company":{"id":1474,"name":"SNK"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":181239,"company":{"id":2230,"name":"Nazca Corporation"},"developer":true,"publisher":false}],"name":"Metal Slug","release_dates":[{"id":32662,"date":883526400,"human":"1997","y":1997},{"id":32665,"date":1356912000,"human":"2012","y":2012},{"id":126725,"date":836524800,"human":"Jul 05, 1996","y":1996},{"id":126728,"date":831427200,"human":"May 07, 1996","y":1996},{"id":141288,"date":1211760000,"human":"May 26, 2008","y":2008},{"id":141289,"date":1210291200,"human":"May 09, 2008","y":2008},{"id":141290,"date":1208822400,"human":"Apr 22, 2008","y":2008},{"id":195068,"date":1435190400,"human":"Jun 25, 2015","y":2015},{"id":320247,"date":883526400,"human":"1997","y":1997},{"id":370980,"date":1355875200,"human":"Dec 19, 2012","y":2012},{"id":376911,"date":829872000,"human":"Apr 19, 1996","y":1996},{"id":377006,"date":822441600,"human":"Jan 24, 1996","y":1996},{"id":377007,"date":832896000,"human":"May 24, 1996","y":1996}],"screenshots":[{"id":85278,"image_id":"xwupa65o4su4fklevqwn"},{"id":85279,"image_id":"pkgy0vh3uww0vbdavoi1"},{"id":85280,"image_id":"stjez9zyonlugya3whub"},{"id":85281,"image_id":"qptrjpesvldzpxx7x8t9"},{"id":85282,"image_id":"oz5kmecrirjvycobbi1s"}],"summary":"Metal Slug is a 1996 run and gun arcade video game originally developed by Nazca Corporation and released by SNK for the Neo Geo MVS.

Final Fight can be played by up to two players simultaneously. Before the game begins, the player chooses between the three main characters: Haggar, Cody, and Guy. Each has his own fighting style and attributes. Health gauges are displayed for both player and enemy characters.\n\nThe controls for Final Fight consist of an eight-way joystick and two buttons for attacking and jumping respectively. Pressing the attack button repeatedly when attacking an enemy or multiple enemies will cause the player character to perform a combo. The final blow of the combo can be changed to a throw if the player moves the joystick in the opposite direction just before landing it. The player can also perform a jump attack. Pressing the attack and jump buttons simultaneously allows the player to perform a special attack that strikes all surrounding enemies, but will drain a small portion of the player's health.\n\nEnemies can be grabbed simply by walking into one of them. When an enemy is grabbed, the player can perform a grab attack by pressing the attack button or perform a throw by tilting the joystick left or right. A thrown enemy can be tossed at another for additional damage. Items such as weapons, health recovery items, and items awarding extra points can be picked up by standing over one and pressing the attack button. Weapons have limited uses and will disappear if the player is disarmed by an enemy too much or when the player moves to a new area.\n\nFinal Fight consists of six stages or \"rounds\", as well as two bonus rounds. Each round takes place in a different section of Metro City such as the Slums and the Subway, with most rounds featuring more than one level. At the end of each round the player will face a boss character unique to that round.","total_rating":79.99818064872892,"total_rating_count":121},{"id":1656,"cover":{"id":199613,"image_id":"co4a0t"},"genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Fighting"},{"id":25,"name":"Hack and slash/Beat 'em up"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":33,"name":"Arcade"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":173382,"company":{"id":37,"name":"Capcom"},"developer":true,"publisher":true},{"id":246343,"company":{"id":33804,"name":"Playtronic"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Final Fight 2","release_dates":[{"id":548539,"date":1474502400,"human":"Sep 22, 2016","y":2016},{"id":548540,"date":1473292800,"human":"Sep 08, 2016","y":2016},{"id":548541,"date":738028800,"human":"May 22, 1993","y":1993},{"id":548542,"date":754704000,"human":"Dec 1993","y":1993},{"id":548543,"date":745372800,"human":"Aug 15, 1993","y":1993},{"id":548544,"date":775699200,"human":"Aug 1994","y":1994},{"id":548545,"date":1255305600,"human":"Oct 12, 2009","y":2009},{"id":548546,"date":1255046400,"human":"Oct 09, 2009","y":2009},{"id":548547,"date":1255046400,"human":"Oct 09, 2009","y":2009},{"id":548548,"date":1380758400,"human":"Oct 03, 2013","y":2013},{"id":548549,"date":1380758400,"human":"Oct 03, 2013","y":2013},{"id":548550,"date":1409097600,"human":"Aug 27, 2014","y":2014}],"screenshots":[{"id":111208,"image_id":"wto5ctpiya6bpzehtvjj"},{"id":158853,"image_id":"fziwfjf9kw84ibdmkt4u"},{"id":158854,"image_id":"memlibzx2sahlaqzk0bs"},{"id":158855,"image_id":"zxfnr6a7h4sdfq0uu9cc"},{"id":158856,"image_id":"hb5wdis198zwtmgkmbcl"},{"id":158857,"image_id":"kytxxrxw7d1h77jujhs8"},{"id":158858,"image_id":"rsvavjuvt4ydg3md4ejr"}],"summary":"A beat'em up sequel to Final Fight, released originally for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.","total_rating":80.00405356907103,"total_rating_count":51},{"id":1699,"cover":{"id":89061,"image_id":"co1wpx"},"genres":[{"id":8,"name":"Platform"},{"id":9,"name":"Puzzle"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":15865,"company":{"id":1809,"name":"Nintendo R&D1"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":130890,"company":{"id":70,"name":"Nintendo"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":130891,"company":{"id":70,"name":"Nintendo"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":223783,"company":{"id":5163,"name":"iQue"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":224780,"company":{"id":812,"name":"Gradiente"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Wario Land 4","release_dates":[{"id":509982,"date":998352000,"human":"Aug 21, 2001","y":2001},{"id":509983,"date":1086652800,"human":"Jun 08, 2004","y":2004},{"id":509985,"date":1005264000,"human":"Nov 09, 2001","y":2001},{"id":509986,"date":1005868800,"human":"Nov 16, 2001","y":2001},{"id":509987,"date":1006128000,"human":"Nov 19, 2001","y":2001},{"id":509988,"date":1323993600,"human":"Dec 16, 2011","y":2011},{"id":509989,"date":1323907200,"human":"Dec 15, 2011","y":2011},{"id":509990,"date":1401926400,"human":"Jun 05, 2014","y":2014},{"id":509991,"date":1401926400,"human":"Jun 05, 2014","y":2014},{"id":509992,"date":1398816000,"human":"Apr 30, 2014","y":2014},{"id":509993,"date":1399507200,"human":"May 08, 2014","y":2014},{"id":549160,"date":1007164800,"human":"Dec 2001","y":2001}],"screenshots":[{"id":39925,"image_id":"ap8jjdbjtfsg19izye6k"},{"id":39926,"image_id":"zp5gyi1ncwblddl6e3rc"},{"id":39927,"image_id":"ttvebiv0qzzwnlmapgbp"},{"id":178017,"image_id":"ukumgp2wcdkt9razdghd"},{"id":178018,"image_id":"mxeuijrbxpdqw0sgsxgs"},{"id":178019,"image_id":"u3dr17ukru62loxqg2xo"},{"id":178020,"image_id":"u1ove6exao2s9kswszva"},{"id":178021,"image_id":"mot2pvkfgls6fjuejirs"},{"id":178022,"image_id":"o1dags88sz8xreryuzsp"},{"id":178023,"image_id":"ami6f8gbhh22x6ozx4yt"},{"id":178024,"image_id":"qlmnfdgvrwpc6rxvvdkq"},{"id":178025,"image_id":"ww0i0mydsujgmvdw0zkx"}],"summary":"Wario's back for more...and more...and MORE!\n\nHey!

A handful of colonists struck out on their own to begin anew - far away from the Earth and its turmoil. Several ships were launched with enough equipment and supplies to give the hundreds onboard a fighting chance - but since the area around far-off Sirius had never been surveyed, no one really knew what to expect. What they found was a new frontier of free-flowing natural resources, unexplored territories, great wonders and lurking dangers. Each ship, representing the clusters of people and their earthly place of origin, settled into different parts of the galaxy pre-selected by their ship-board computer to give them the best chance of survival.\n\nLife was hard in the beginning, but over the 800 years the different colonies prospered and expanded their territories, claiming more and more systems for their own. Survival and propagation eventually led to growth and profit as each of the colonies developed specialties and fostered commerce. As the colonies grew and time passed their connections with their roots on Earth dwindled and they lost their memories of the conflicts of the past. Soon their attention was dominated by new, more immediate conflicts. Feelings of lost ancestral connection spurred anachronism in the look of the great cities, and created a somewhat distorted image of each colony's cultural heritage. In the ever-expanding outer edge of the territories, frontier lawlessness prevailed.\n\nThe Houses: Each shipboard colony that left Earth carried some memory of its origins in its name. The Liberty carried Americans, The Bretonia flew from The United Kingdom and surrounding territory, The Kusari from Asia, and the Rheinland launched with Germanic cargo.\n\nAs each ship settled and colonies began to expand, they knew little about each other and their advancing development. Finally, little by little, the individual colonies found each other and began to set up trade routes to link their systems for commerce and solidarity.\n\nToday, with each colony firmly rooted in its respective corner of the galaxy, the colonies rely heavily on each other for trade and industry but also compete for resources and new territories in the Border Worlds. The colonies mandate member governments in \"The New Alliance\" within the Sirius sector. To control conflicts, each colony has forged alliances and treaties with others as they have grown. Competition remains fierce, however. Struggles rage for supremacy in business, commerce, resources, power and control. There can be tenuous peace between colonies' political agendas, but the grabs for holdings constantly unsettle the volatile frontier.","total_rating":76.5644034557561,"total_rating_count":57},{"id":2143,"cover":{"id":265997,"image_id":"co5p8t"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":4455,"company":{"id":4,"name":"Eidos Interactive"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":4456,"company":{"id":1008,"name":"Free Radical Design"},"developer":true,"publisher":false}],"name":"TimeSplitters 2","release_dates":[{"id":4393,"date":1034121600,"human":"Oct 09, 2002","y":2002},{"id":4394,"date":1034726400,"human":"Oct 16, 2002","y":2002},{"id":4395,"date":1034812800,"human":"Oct 17, 2002","y":2002},{"id":146006,"date":1034726400,"human":"Oct 16, 2002","y":2002},{"id":146007,"date":1036108800,"human":"Nov 01, 2002","y":2002}],"screenshots":[{"id":181875,"image_id":"ojudwwjekxahj5b685cs"},{"id":181876,"image_id":"w412ffebma21gajpdclo"},{"id":181877,"image_id":"vjnpillkfjr1dga4d6xn"},{"id":181878,"image_id":"wfhabusr7p2itkfkh29i"},{"id":181879,"image_id":"ttbo5yd3uzdqe37ngbnp"},{"id":181880,"image_id":"lt7bfsmrljp9ut8aljer"},{"id":181881,"image_id":"cylvnlakavtlc7mcckz8"},{"id":181882,"image_id":"jpp1l1m4bpsibnjptaer"},{"id":181883,"image_id":"oiyne0bjm13tqrbepkoi"},{"id":181884,"image_id":"wnbkqf2bjt17lqvknmb5"},{"id":181885,"image_id":"dy6d7iwlgxyyrhjzdkaa"},{"id":181886,"image_id":"pezzyqpe1m4lgisfkwdv"}],"summary":"TimeSplitters 2 is a first-person shooter that requires players to kill enemies and complete objectives using a variety of weapons and tactics in different predefined scenarios.

The player can move along platforms, as well as jump to those above and to the side, similar to most platform games.\n\nThe player can also blow bubbles. These can trap enemies, who are defeated if the bubble is then burst by the player's spiny back. Bubbles that contain enemies can be popped at the same time resulting in different foods being projected around the level. Each enemy trapped in a bubble equates to a different food. Food is consumed and transferred to points (an increasing scale of 1000 points is awarded for each enemy burst in tandem with another meaning: one enemy burst equals one food item worth 1000 points, two enemies burst equals two food items worth 1000 and 2000 points, three enemies burst equals three food items worth 1000, 2000 and 4000 points, and so on), which results in earning lives. These same bubbles also float for a time before bursting, and can be jumped on, allowing access to otherwise inaccessible areas. Players progress to the next level once all enemies on the current level are defeated.\n\nEnemies turn \"angry\" — becoming pink-colored and moving faster — if they are the last enemy remaining, escape from a bubble after being left too long or a certain amount of time has been spent on the current level. A monster will also become angry if either player collects a skull (the only negative item in the game), and the monster is hit by the resulting comet crossing the screen (however, this is a rare occurrence).\n\nAfter a further time limit expires, an additional invincible enemy appears for each player, actively chasing them using only vertical and horizontal movements. These do not need to be defeated to complete the level, and disappear once a player's life is lost.\n\nContact with enemies and their projectiles (rocks, lasers, fireballs, etc.) results in death.","total_rating":78.75778863012619,"total_rating_count":110},{"id":2686,"cover":{"id":79580,"image_id":"co1pek"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"},{"id":9,"name":"Puzzle"},{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"id":13,"name":"Simulator"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":6416,"company":{"id":70,"name":"Nintendo"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":6417,"company":{"id":771,"name":"Rare"},"developer":true,"publisher":false}],"name":"Star Fox Adventures","release_dates":[{"id":77321,"date":1033084800,"human":"Sep 27, 2002","y":2002},{"id":77322,"date":1037318400,"human":"Nov 15, 2002","y":2002},{"id":77323,"date":1037923200,"human":"Nov 22, 2002","y":2002},{"id":143497,"date":1032652800,"human":"Sep 22, 2002","y":2002}],"screenshots":[{"id":20895,"image_id":"oqbwq4i35nmm3u2upszb"},{"id":22636,"image_id":"monkrqbsxlwk2ppqkuys"},{"id":22637,"image_id":"anms8riskt3juhl8jzhu"},{"id":22638,"image_id":"uqudirtteamr589ha2om"},{"id":22639,"image_id":"qrew53hzwyjebnrwzfj6"},{"id":173778,"image_id":"vsloukygmvhqsspr29mk"},{"id":173779,"image_id":"jow9oscrzmyk04swssy3"},{"id":173780,"image_id":"yikp9ndbdomveqgi9j3g"},{"id":173781,"image_id":"v2um48vwg98106ved4cs"},{"id":173782,"image_id":"ov0zuqgxx64oplv9tr2x"},{"id":173783,"image_id":"f56rjw1kdq9dvxzspc8o"},{"id":173784,"image_id":"j50khsyic3fwwrea8q7r"}],"summary":"Fox Mccloud takes a break from flying his arwing and signs up for a mission on land, a beautiful, magical land called Dinosaur Planet.\n\nAlthough the player controls Fox for almost the entirety of the game, the first level of Star Fox Adventures involves playing as another fox called Krystal, who speaks another language, from a different planet called Cerinia.\n\nKrystal is looking for answers to the destruction of her home planet, and the murder of her parents. She lands on Krazoa Palace after receiving a distress call from Dinosaur Planet, but an unfortunate event occurs during her exploration of this location.\n\nMeanwhile, General Pepper contacts the Star Fox Team and asks them to investigate Dinosaur Planet. One of the main reasons for the investigation, is that large chunks of the planet have become detached for an unexplained reason.\n\nFox McCloud agrees to take a look. On the planet's surface, Fox comes across a magical staff that becomes his sole weapon in the game.\n\nFox learns from the Triceratops Queen of the EarthWalker Tribe that General Scales, a member of a different tribe, has stolen the four Spellstones from the planet's two Force Point Temples, causing the detachment of parts of the planet.\n\nTo prevent the planet from breaking up further and restore it to its original unity, The player must control Fox and restore the Spellstones to the temples.

It was released as an arcade game in the fall of 1994 and, the following year, ported to the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and the Game Boy. The game's plot involves an all-powerful corporation organising a fighting tournament. The story was adapted in a limited comic book series published under the short-lived Acclaim Comics imprint.\n\nKiller Instinct features several gameplay elements unique to fighting games of the time. Instead of fighting enemies in best-of-three rounds bouts, each player has two life bars. The player that depletes the other player's life bars first wins the match. The game also introduced \"auto-doubles\", a feature which allows players to press a certain sequence of buttons to make characters automatically perform combos on opponents. Also featured in the game are \"combo breakers\", special defensive moves that can interrupt combos.","total_rating":73.04771106557305,"total_rating_count":94},{"id":2947,"cover":{"id":160842,"image_id":"co3g3u"},"genres":[{"id":4,"name":"Fighting"},{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":19689,"company":{"id":205,"name":"GT Interactive Software"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":19690,"company":{"id":224,"name":"3D Realms"},"developer":true,"publisher":true},{"id":19691,"company":{"id":1371,"name":"General Arcade"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":19692,"company":{"id":378,"name":"Westlake Interactive"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":19693,"company":{"id":634,"name":"Devolver Digital"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":19694,"company":{"id":130,"name":"MacSoft Games"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":19696,"company":{"id":224,"name":"3D Realms"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":237696,"company":{"id":1746,"name":"Atari Games"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Shadow Warrior","release_dates":[{"id":23157,"date":863481600,"human":"May 13, 1997","y":1997},{"id":23158,"date":875664000,"human":"Oct 01, 1997","y":1997},{"id":23159,"date":1355875200,"human":"Dec 19, 2012","y":2012},{"id":23160,"date":883526400,"human":"1997","y":1997},{"id":23161,"date":1369785600,"human":"May 29, 2013","y":2013},{"id":23162,"date":1369785600,"human":"May 29, 2013","y":2013},{"id":23163,"date":1112313600,"human":"Apr 01, 2005","y":2005}],"screenshots":[{"id":100667,"image_id":"wrhxnv67sghlnoa1mmve"},{"id":100668,"image_id":"vglazuohhsmycbrqlwvm"},{"id":100669,"image_id":"vezjfbbb3kxnhzdqfjxh"},{"id":100670,"image_id":"n2b8xvee2wtealobfhd1"},{"id":100671,"image_id":"rixglpugfd73h3dimang"}],"summary":"Shadow Warrior is a first-person shooter video game developed by 3D Realms and released on May 13, 1997 by GT Interactive.

Mark Adams ported Shadow Warrior to Mac OS in August 1997.\n\nThe game's improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although ultra-violent, the game emphasized tongue-in-cheek humor and contained some sexual themes (although less blatantly than in Duke Nukem 3D).

Because he does not possess any power in reality, Mortus sends Sketch into the world of his own comic, freely drawing in enemies to try and kill him.\n\nInside the comic book, Sketch meets General Alissa Cyan, who believes he is a superhero (\"the chosen one\") who came to save their post-apocalyptic world from the evil of Mortus and the alien invaders. Ignoring Sketch's protests, Alissa sends him on his mission, keeping in touch with instructions and hints via radio. It is up to Sketch to stop Mortus' evil plans and find a way out of this comic world before his own creations erase him for good.\n\nThe game has two possible endings. At the end of the game, Alissa attempts to defuse a Nuke, when Mortus comes into the comic and throws her into the chamber, which starts to fill up with liquid. Mortus then battles Sketch. If the player defeats Mortus and the Kreeps he summons quickly enough to drain the liquid and save Alissa, an ending occurs where Alissa comes to the real world with Sketch. Comix Zone is a huge success, being sold out on its first day, and Alissa joins the army, eventually becoming Chief of Security for the United States. Roadkill is given a vast amount of mozzarella cheese, and spends a lot of time exploring the city's new sewer system when not sleeping under a pile of Sketch's dirty socks.\n\nIf the player defeats Mortus after the chamber fills with liquid, Alissa dies. Sketch comes out, but his comic is destroyed. The last sentence in the cutscene says \"Will Sketch recreate his adventure for a happier ending?\"","total_rating":75.68440482124626,"total_rating_count":103},{"id":3109,"cover":{"id":128289,"image_id":"co2qzl"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"},{"id":32,"name":"Indie"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8764,"company":{"id":935,"name":"Running with Scissors"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":8765,"company":{"id":1477,"name":"Whiptail Interactive"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Postal 2","release_dates":[{"id":6994,"date":1113523200,"human":"Apr 15, 2005","y":2005},{"id":6995,"date":1050192000,"human":"Apr 13, 2003","y":2003}],"screenshots":[{"id":19821,"image_id":"c0hltjwoiv887mz6kzs7"},{"id":19822,"image_id":"btu7qvp21wgnzvu1isac"},{"id":19823,"image_id":"iyuzm2cidh9dzefeeskd"},{"id":19824,"image_id":"ctrmgrlgh0rkftjlgdxs"},{"id":19825,"image_id":"gpa6fh5cdw0sbbjn4j3z"}],"summary":"Try to live a week as The Postal Dude doing everyday chores on your to-do list, such as picking up milk at the grocery store.

Its success led to the production of several updated versions, each offering additional features and characters over previous versions, as well as many home versions. Some of the home versions of the Street Fighter II games have sold millions of copies, with the SNES port of the first Street Fighter II being Capcom's best-selling consumer game of all-time as of 2008.\n\nStreet Fighter II follows several of the conventions and rules already established by its original 1987 predecessor. The player engages opponents in one-on-one close quarter combat in a series of best-two-out-of-three matches. The objective of each round is to deplete the opponent's vitality before the timer runs out. If both opponents knock each other out at the same time or the timer runs out with both fighters having an equal amount of vitality left, a \"double KO\" or \"draw game\" is declared and additional rounds will be played until sudden death. In the first Street Fighter II, a match could last up to ten rounds if there was no clear winner; this was reduced to four rounds in Champion Edition and onward. If there is no clear winner by the end of the final round, then either the computer-controlled opponent will win by default in a single-player match or both fighters will lose in a 2-player match.\n\nAfter every third match in the single player mode, the player will participate in a \"bonus game\" for additional points. The bonus games includes (in order) a car-breaking event; a barrel breaking bonus game where the barrels are dropped off from a conveyor belt above the player; and a drum-breaking bonus game where drums are flammable and piled over each other. The bonus games were removed from the arcade version of Super Street Fighter II Turbo.\n\nLike in the original, the game's controls uses a configuration of an eight-directional joystick and six attack buttons. The player uses the joystick to jump, crouch and move the character towards or away from the opponent, as well as to guard the character from an opponent's attacks. There are three punch buttons and three kick buttons of differing strength and speed (Light, Medium and Heavy). The player can perform a variety of basic moves in any position, including grabbing/throwing attacks, which were not featured in the original Street Fighter. Like in the original, the player can perform special moves by inputting a combination of directional and button-based commands.\n\nStreet Fighter II differs from the original due to the selection of multiple playable characters, each with their distinct fighting styles and special moves. Additionally, the player can also \"cancel\" during animation by performing another move, allowing for a combination of several basic and special moves. Both of these features would be expanded upon in subsequent installments.","total_rating":83.05704026012067,"total_rating_count":320},{"id":3201,"cover":{"id":122638,"image_id":"co2mmm"},"genres":[{"id":5,"name":"Shooter"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":8234,"company":{"id":1610,"name":"Innerloop Studios"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":8235,"company":{"id":4,"name":"Eidos Interactive"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In","release_dates":[{"id":52013,"date":976838400,"human":"Dec 15, 2000","y":2000},{"id":52014,"date":976924800,"human":"Dec 16, 2000","y":2000}],"screenshots":[{"id":8208,"image_id":"a0rq6buma7uvhnmebp7w"},{"id":8209,"image_id":"asleosuc4stryvncsx2u"},{"id":8210,"image_id":"bykfxjjxcfiinuvo3rbr"},{"id":8211,"image_id":"xjir5opcv0sekhkld0fh"},{"id":8212,"image_id":"lko9oqfzxyegf9t9bvne"}],"summary":"Project I.G.I.: I'm Going In (released in Europe as simply Project I.G.I.) is a tactical first-person shooter developed by Innerloop Studios and released on December 15, 2000 by Eidos Interactive.

Depending on the version of the game, the characters are either, chosen at the start of the game or assigned by control panel. After Shredder kidnaps the Turtles' friend April O'Neil and their mentor Splinter, they must give chase, save their comrades, and defeat the evil Shredder. Up to four players (two in some versions) can take control of any of the Turtles. Donatello has slower attacks but a longer range, Michelangelo and Raphael have faster attacks but a shorter range, and Leonardo is a well-rounded Turtle with average range and speed.\n\nThe eight-way joystick controls the movements of the Turtle, the jump button makes them jump and the attack button makes them hit in front of them using their weapon. In addition to this, some combinations are possible. The Turtles can throw Foot soldiers overhead, and by pressing the jump and attack buttons, a special attack is performed. Raphael rolls along the ground and finishes with a kick, while the other Turtles do a sweeping jump attack with their weapons. Turtles can also spring off the wall in certain areas. Enemies can be defeated more quickly by slamming them into walls or solid objects. Many objects such as traffic cones, parking meters, fire hydrants and exploding oil drums can be hit or damaged with attacks in order to help defeat nearby enemies. In the attract mode, the game showed the first part of the cartoon opening, along with a portion of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme song.\n\nMost of the enemies the Turtles face are the Foot Soldiers, all color-coded to indicate their attack patterns and weapon of choices. Some enemies, such as the standard purple-clad Foot Soldiers and Roadkill Rodney robots, have the ability to restrain the Turtles' mobility and drain their health, leaving the player open to attack for other enemies. The bosses in the game include Rocksteady and Bebop (individually at first in that order, and later the two of them together), Baxter Stockman, Granitor, General Traag, Krang, and Shredder himself.","total_rating":60.45844834954742,"total_rating_count":81},{"id":3840,"cover":{"id":126527,"image_id":"co2pmn"},"genres":[{"id":10,"name":"Racing"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":9965,"company":{"id":287,"name":"Acclaim Entertainment"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":9966,"company":{"id":347,"name":"Criterion Games"},"developer":true,"publisher":false}],"name":"Burnout 2: Point of Impact","release_dates":[{"id":68095,"date":1033344000,"human":"Sep 30, 2002","y":2002},{"id":68096,"date":1034294400,"human":"Oct 11, 2002","y":2002},{"id":68097,"date":1080777600,"human":"Apr 01, 2004","y":2004},{"id":68098,"date":1049846400,"human":"Apr 09, 2003","y":2003},{"id":68099,"date":1052438400,"human":"May 09, 2003","y":2003},{"id":68100,"date":1051747200,"human":"May 01, 2003","y":2003},{"id":68101,"date":1052438400,"human":"May 09, 2003","y":2003},{"id":138076,"date":1049846400,"human":"Apr 09, 2003","y":2003}],"screenshots":[{"id":154078,"image_id":"hktvdl2hwavbdayqk9wf"},{"id":154079,"image_id":"xugcr624vd6s9ahinla2"},{"id":154080,"image_id":"s9t8hlxlpb9ncdf5luq3"},{"id":154081,"image_id":"lolpm2t4d4jshsboursz"},{"id":154082,"image_id":"en6ynyd1kwecwdppdq65"},{"id":154083,"image_id":"l32zgajnlfw9agiglmvu"},{"id":154084,"image_id":"v1klsdns62u0snrzutl9"},{"id":154085,"image_id":"unylrj83mkcdvnvthqls"},{"id":154086,"image_id":"wkkxtqz4mkgy6ab6jnog"},{"id":154087,"image_id":"vuibopzatek3kyohudfk"}],"summary":"Burnout is a street racing game focused around speed and crashing.

Many of these weapons can be charged for a powerful attack and some weapons, such as the club, can be used to access areas that are otherwise inaccessible. When not possessing any items, Dan is able to rip his own arm off and use it for both melee and ranged attacks. Dan can equip a shield alongside weapons to defend against attacks; though they can only take several hits of damage before breaking. Throughout the game, Dan can visit gargoyle heads of two varieties; green ones offer Dan information while blue ones allow Dan to buy services or ammunition by using the treasures he finds.\n\nDan's health is determined by a single health bar, which reduces when Dan is hit. It will deplete completely if Dan drowns or falls from a great height. If Dan completely runs out of health, the game will end. Dan can extend his maximum health by collecting Life Bottles, which will automatically refill his health bar if it drops to zero. Also hidden throughout the game are Life Vials and Life Fountains that can replenish Dan's health and fill up any empty Life Bottles Dan has. In each level, there is a hidden Chalice of Souls, which can be collected if the player fills it with enough souls from defeated enemies (some Chalices are awarded via other means).

In addition to navigating the main characters around the mansion grounds, players are able to enter Viewfinder Mode, where the camera is raised and the view changes to that of the camera's frame. In viewfinder mode the player is able to snap photographs of ghosts, both violent and benign, which is the main method of progressing through the game. Items are also available, some being consumable and most being key items needed to unlock doors, complete tasks or solve puzzles. Puzzles are encountered frequently in the game, some being based on the same concept but becoming progressively more difficult. The varying difficulty settings of the game (Easy, Normal, Hard, Nightmare, or Fatal (Xbox only)) determine the amount of consumable items scattered throughout the mansion and how formidable the enemies are.\n\nThe main horror aspect of the game is, undoubtedly, the ghosts. The mechanics programmed for the ghosts allow them to float ethereally through the air, walls and floors, and even teleport, allowing them many ways to attack the player. The ghosts' appearances are usually inspired by their deaths or by Japanese stigmas of horror, which, some argue, are particularily chilling.\n\nThe game, depending on which console it is played on, offers two endings. Upon completion of the game, a ranking is given based on total time taken, points accumulated and other categories. The player is also given rewards and unlockables, such as alternate costumes and camera functions, depending on what difficulty was beaten, how much of the Ghost List was completed and other criteria. Beating the game also unlocks Battle Mode, where the player is faced with fighting specific ghosts, and is rewarded with points towards purchasing unlockables. An option is also given where the game can be replayed with all equipment, upgrades and unlockables carried over.","total_rating":77.42454456218753,"total_rating_count":50},{"id":5378,"cover":{"id":98098,"image_id":"co23oy"},"genres":[{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":149179,"company":{"id":2359,"name":"Novotrade"},"developer":true,"publisher":false},{"id":203371,"company":{"id":112,"name":"Sega"},"developer":false,"publisher":true},{"id":227834,"company":{"id":23993,"name":"Tec Toy"},"developer":false,"publisher":true}],"name":"Ecco the Dolphin","release_dates":[{"id":12783,"date":743904000,"human":"Jul 29, 1993","y":1993},{"id":146218,"date":1164672000,"human":"Nov 28, 2006","y":2006},{"id":146219,"date":1165536000,"human":"Dec 08, 2006","y":2006},{"id":146220,"date":1165017600,"human":"Dec 02, 2006","y":2006},{"id":338510,"date":817603200,"human":"Nov 29, 1995","y":1995},{"id":338511,"date":725068800,"human":"Dec 23, 1992","y":1992},{"id":338514,"date":823132800,"human":"Feb 1996","y":1996},{"id":338515,"date":850435200,"human":"Dec 13, 1996","y":1996},{"id":338516,"date":725587200,"human":"Dec 29, 1992","y":1992},{"id":338517,"date":743990400,"human":"Jul 30, 1993","y":1993},{"id":420672,"date":1275350400,"human":"Jun 01, 2010","y":2010},{"id":420673,"date":1275350400,"human":"Jun 01, 2010","y":2010},{"id":420674,"date":1275350400,"human":"Jun 01, 2010","y":2010},{"id":437389,"date":1279756800,"human":"Jul 22, 2010","y":2010},{"id":437390,"date":1275350400,"human":"Jun 01, 2010","y":2010},{"id":507249,"date":729302400,"human":"Feb 10, 1993","y":1993}],"screenshots":[{"id":44917,"image_id":"tav2hke9dnryynke5mqd"},{"id":44918,"image_id":"e1b3gskkzrdenxpumwz3"},{"id":44919,"image_id":"uza6mh9br5hj0rmaqkn7"},{"id":44920,"image_id":"j2rye40bl5onzapxbkgh"},{"id":182149,"image_id":"rbczr0ylpg5hxegxxvwj"},{"id":182150,"image_id":"bbvuoewoiqygc6e849dc"},{"id":182151,"image_id":"dtobfaee4ipmoqnrbl7v"},{"id":182152,"image_id":"ozgvl59vvcccf3phapet"},{"id":182153,"image_id":"qd9ha2s5yoh4ck9fr3z7"}],"summary":"Life was an adventure for Ecco, the young dolphin.

is made through the game by fighting through Death Adder's henchmen, including men armed with clubs and maces, skeleton warriors, and knights. Players are able to attack using their weapon, jump and cast spells that hurt all enemies on the screen. The force of this magic depends on the number of \"bars\" of magic power currently available. The bars are filled by collecting blue 'magic potions' attained by kicking little sprites who then drop the potions. These sprites appear during regular levels and during bonus stages in between levels. The male warrior Ax is able to cast earth spells. The dwarf Gilius, casts lightning spells and the female warrior Tyris casts fire magic. Each character has a different number of maximum magic bars and varying ranges of attack.\n\nVarious steeds known as bizarrians are found in the game. These can be ridden when the enemy rider is knocked off, or if one is found dormant. The least powerful steed is known as the Cockatrice, which can be used to knock down enemies with a swipe of its tail. The more powerful dragon, which can either shoot fireballs or breathe fire, is found later in the game.","total_rating":70.14899886486185,"total_rating_count":183},{"id":5611,"cover":{"id":322303,"image_id":"co6wov"},"genres":[{"id":2,"name":"Point-and-click"},{"id":12,"name":"Role-playing (RPG)"},{"id":31,"name":"Adventure"}],"involved_companies":[{"id":163445,"company":{"id":2050,"name":"Jagex Ltd.

The game is considered by Gametrailers.com to be the world's second most difficult game ever made. The player can only be hit twice before losing a life (the first hit takes away Arthur's armor, and the player must continue on in his underwear until completing the level, or finding replacement armor). If the player loses a life, he is returned to the start of the level, or the halfway point if he has managed to get that far. Furthermore, each life can only last a certain length of time (generally around three minutes), the clock being reset at the start of a level. If the clock does run out, the player instantly loses that life. After defeating the final boss, but only with the cross weapon (if the player does not have the cross weapon, they will be prompted that it is needed to defeat the boss and restart at the beginning of level 5 and must repeat round 5 and 6 again regardless if the weapon is obtained immediately or not) for the first time the player is informed that the battle was \"a trap devised by Satan\".

Along the way, Arthur can pick up a variety of weapons and armor to help him in his quest. While the core gameplay remains the same as its predecessor, the game now allows Arthur to fire directly upward and directly downward while in mid air.\n\nBy jumping in certain spots, players can cause a treasure chest to erupt from the ground. By firing his weapon at the chest, players may uncover new weapons, gold armor or an evil magician that changes Arthur into an elderly man or a helpless duck. The gold armor allows players to charge up the weapon to release a powerful magical attack. Each weapon has its own special attack.\n\nThere are five levels and Lucifer's chamber at the end, considered a sixth level in itself. To defeat the game, Arthur must complete level 1 to 5 twice. Upon completing level's 1 to 5 the first time, Arthur is taken back to level 1 again but this time a special weapon appears during the game.
